    those spectacular destinations that most travellers have on their Africa 
    bucket list, and with good reason. There are a ton of magical places to visit in Kenya, 
    each offering their own unique charm and attractions. The Masai Mara is where to go in 
    Kenya for the famed and dramatic wildebeest migration, but there’s also a great deal 
    more to see in this East African country.<br /><br />
    Kenya offers a holiday for every traveller. From unforgettable Kenya family safaris that offer 
    child-friendly activities and services, to exclusive hideaways for romantics, from adventurous 
    honeymoons to small groups of friends and family celebrating a milestone anniversary. Whatever 
    type of traveller you are, there’s not much that beats a Kenya holiday – the standards of service
     are high and Kenya’s top destinations offer luxury accommodation 
    ranging from lavish, colonial-style lodges to funky boutique hotels and amenity-packed resorts.<br /><br />
    Kenya’s high population growth rate has produced a relatively young population. In the 1979 census 48.5% 
    of the population were less than 15 years old and this is estimated to have risen to 55% in 1988. The workforce is now smaller than its dependants. Most of Kenya’s 
    population live in the rural areas. In 1988 an estimated 18% of the population lived in urban areas. <br /><br />
    Tourism is Kenya’s the second largest foreign exchange earner. The enduring appeal of the country’s 
    scenery, wildlife, climate and tropical coastline has allowed the establishment of a large hotel 
    industry and a sound tourism base. There is a fairly pronounced seasonal pattern with a majority 
    of tourists visiting during the northern hemisphere holiday period (July/August/September) and 
    during the northern winter months (December/January/February). 
    The rainy seasons in April/May and in November reduce the potential for visitors at these times.`,

          The nickname neatly sums up the East African country’s 
          rich beauty in three simple words, encapsulating everything from its vibrant colours and 
          lush vegetation to the magnificent wildlife that roams its plains. 
          Today, the moniker is as valid as ever, as Uganda has grown into one of Africa’s most 
          coveted travel sojourns.
          Uganda is home to the highest density of primates and gorillas in the world. 
          The expansive rainforest jungles of this landlocked country in East Africa are home
          to 20 species of primates, 
          including mountain gorillas, chimpanzees and golden monkeys.

          Visa and entry
          <br />
          A Single Entry Visa is $50 for most nationalities. 
          It is advised to get in advance from the Uganda eVisa website. 
          You can also get a Multi-Entry Visa and the East Africa

          People & Culture
          <br />
          Uganda’s 34 million people are concentrated in the country’s better watered south and west with the Kampala-based Baganda the largest of the country’s many ethnic groups. 
          Some 40 regional languages exist but Swahili and English are Uganda’s official languages. 
          Religious belief is overwhelmingly Christian-based though Islam is strong in Uganda’s Asian communities. 
          It should be noted that Ugandans hold their ancestry in high regard.
          Uganda is a conservative country and visitors would do well to adhere to local rules of behaviour. 
          That said, visitors often remark on the friendliness and politeness of the locals: greetings are an elaborate affair and may include inquiries as to the health of your family – perfunctory greetings and a demand for immediate action are somewhat frowned upon!

          Languages
          <br />
          Uganda is a multilingual nation with English as the official langauge and Swahili as the natural language. 
          However, thre are over 40 languages spoken across the country, reflecting its ethnic diversity. Luganda, spoken by the Baganda people, is widely spoken in the central region and is often used in business and daily transactions. 
          Other prominent languages include Runyankole in the west, Lusoga in the east, and Acholi in the north.

Originally gazetted as a game reserve in 1926, the park was officially designated as one of Uganda’s first national parks in 1952. It lies at the northern end of the Albertine Rift Valley, where the Bunyoro escarpment descends into rolling, palm-dotted plains, offering one of the most dramatic landscapes in East Africa.

    At the heart of the park is Murchison Falls, one of Africa’s most powerful waterfalls. 
    Here, the mighty Victoria Nile is forced through a narrow 8-meter-wide gorge, before plunging 45 meters into the Devil’s Cauldron below, sending up a thunderous roar and a permanent rainbow mist. 
    This breathtaking natural wonder marks the final act in an 80km stretch of rapids, after which the river calms into a broad, tranquil flow as it meanders toward Lake Albert. This stretch of river is one of Uganda’s greatest wildlife viewing spots, attracting elephants, giraffes, and buffaloes to the riverbanks, while hippos, Nile crocodiles, and aquatic birds are ever-present residents.`,

    overview: `The Rwenzori Mountains, often called the “Mountains of the Moon,” rise majestically in western Uganda along the Uganda-DR Congo border. This 120km-long and 65km-wide mountain range is home to some of the most breathtaking and diverse landscapes in Africa, from equatorial snow-capped peaks to lush montane forests and moorlands.
      <br/>
      The park was gazetted in 1991, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, and later designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2008, highlighting its global ecological significance.
      <br/><br/>
      The Roof of Uganda: Margherita Peak (5,109m)<br/>
      The highest point of the Rwenzori Mountains is Margherita Peak (5,109m) on Mount Stanley, making it Africa’s third-highest peak. Unlike East Africa’s volcanic giants such as Kilimanjaro and Mount Elgon, the Rwenzoris were formed by tectonic activity, with massive rock blocks thrust upward from the Western Rift Valley floor.
      <br/>
      The Rwenzoris were first documented by the Alexandrine geographer Ptolemy in AD 150, who referred to them as the “Mountains of the Moon,” believing them to be the source of the Nile River. Later, on May 24, 1888, the explorer Henry Stanley officially placed the Rwenzoris on the world map, recording the name “Ruwenzori,” which he documented as meaning “Rain-Maker” or “Cloud-King” in the local language.
      <br/>
      In 2010, history was made when Ms. Beryl Park, at the age of 78, became the oldest recorded climber to reach Margherita Peak, proving that the Rwenzoris continue to challenge and inspire adventurers of all ages.`,
    highlight: ["Africa’s third-highest peak", "UNESCO World Heritage Site", "Hiking for all levels", "Rich cultural experiences"],
    attractions: `A Landscape Like No Other <br/><br/>
      The Rwenzoris are a mystical wonderland, with their lower slopes covered in rich montane forests, bamboo woodlands, and vast moorlands. As altitude increases, the landscape transforms into an otherworldly botanical paradise, where giant lobelias, tree heathers, and “everlasting flowers” thrive among moss-draped rocks, creating a scene that feels almost magical.
      <br/>
      The park protects the highest parts of the Rwenzori range, sheltering over 70 mammal species and 217 bird species, including 19 Albertine Rift endemics and some of the world’s rarest vegetation. The diverse ecosystems make it an important conservation area and a haven for biodiversity.
      <br/><br/>
      A World-Class Hiking & Mountaineering Destination<br/>
      The Rwenzori Mountains are among Africa’s premier hiking and climbing destinations, offering some of the most rewarding treks on the continent.
      <br/><br/>
      Summit Climbers: Reaching Margherita Peak requires a 9- to 12-day technical ascent, best suited for experienced mountaineers.<br/>
      Mid-Level Treks: Shorter, non-technical treks allow climbers to explore the stunning landscapes and reach lower peaks without the extreme challenge of summiting.<br/>
      Cultural & Nature Walks: For visitors who prefer a less strenuous experience, the neighboring Bakonzo villages offer:<br/>
      ✅ Guided nature walks<br/>

    overview: `Mount Elgon is an extinct volcano and one of Uganda’s oldest geological formations, with its first eruption occurring around 24 million years ago. At one point in history, it was Africa’s tallest mountain, standing even higher than Kilimanjaro’s 5,895m. However, millions of years of erosion have gradually reduced its height to 4,321m, ranking it as the 4th highest peak in East Africa and the 8th highest on the continent.
      <br/><br/>
      A Mountain of Cultural Significance<br/>
      Mount Elgon is home to the Bagisu and Sabiny tribes, while the Ndorobo community has historically lived in the forests of Benet. To the Bagisu (BaMasaba), the mountain represents their ancestral father, Masaba, and they continue to honor this heritage by referring to the mountain by his name.
      <br/>
      The Bagisu circumcision ritual (Imbalu), one of the region’s most significant cultural traditions, is directly tied to the mountain. This public initiation ceremony, held every even-numbered year, marks a young man’s transition into adulthood and attracts visitors from across the country.
      <br/><br/>
      The Largest Volcanic Base in the World <br/>
      With a 4,000 km² base—the largest of any volcano on Earth—Mount Elgon stands as the oldest and largest solitary volcanic mountain in East Africa. The mountain has a diameter of 80km, and its cool, high-altitude climate creates a dramatic contrast to the surrounding hot, dry plains.
      <br/>
      The landscape is shaped by deep valleys, waterfalls, caves, and lush forests, leading to open moorlands and Afro-alpine vegetation at higher elevations. This unique ecological mix provides habitat for diverse wildlife and plant species.`,

      A UNESCO Man & Biosphere Reserve <br/>
      The upper slopes of Mount Elgon are protected within national parks in both Uganda and Kenya, forming a transboundary conservation area. This cross-border park has been designated a UNESCO Man & Biosphere Reserve, recognizing its ecological significance and the need for long-term conservation efforts.
      <br/><br/>
      A Unique Trekking Destination <br/>
      Unlike many other mountains where reaching the highest peak is the ultimate goal, Mount Elgon offers a different kind of adventure. Its highlight is not just Wagagai Peak (4,321m) but also the vast 40km² caldera, one of the largest intact volcanic craters in the world.
      <br/><br/>
      Key Attractions for Trekkers: <br/>
      Wagagai Peak (4,321m) – The highest point of the mountain <br/>
      The Caldera – A vast crater formed by volcanic activity, covering 40km² <br/>
      Endebess Bluff – A towering cliff offering panoramic views <br/>
      Sipi Falls – A stunning three-tiered waterfall on the lower slopes <br/>
      Hot Springs – Naturally heated pools found within the caldera <br/>
      Kitum Cave – A famous elephant cave where these animals extract salt from the rock <br/>
      Mount Elgon’s trails remain less crowded compared to Kilimanjaro or Rwenzori, providing a more peaceful and immersive trekking experience.`,

      Volcanoes National park is a home for golden monkeys, a variety of birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects among other creatures which together make a complete safari package. Volcanoes national park is the pinnacle of Rwanda safaris with majority of the tours starting or ending in the park.
      <br/><br/> Spanning on a 160 sqkm area in the northern part of Rwanda, Volcanoes national park is part of the great Virunga volcano conservation region spanning to cover Virunga National Park Congo and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda. It was initially a small area around Karisimbi, Mikeno and Visoke volcanoes which was gazetted to protect the Mountain gorillas which were facing the threat of extinction as a result of poaching.`,

The park also harbors 178 bird species including at least 29 endemics to Rwenzori mountains and the Virungas.`,
    transport: "Volcanoes National Park is located in a small village called Musanze previously well-known as Ruhengeri, which is very accessible by public transport from Gisenyi or Kigali or from the airport. The drive to Volcanoes national park is 2 hrs and hence one can do gorilla tracking on the same day and drive back to Kigali after the trek. You will be required to arrive at the headquarters of ORTPN in Kinigi, at the park entrance, by 7:00 am, therefore, if you hope to trek gorillas for one day, you have to wake up very early for your journey so that you are on time. However, there isn’t any public transport from Musanze to the headquarters of the park at Kinigi.",

    overview: `Nyungwe is one of the oldest rainforests in Africa, and the largest expanse of forest in Rwanda, covering 1,019 km2 of dense Afromontane forests, bamboo-covered slopes, grasslands and wetlands. The park feeds two of the world’s largest rivers, the Congo and the Nile, and provides a significant portion of Rwanda’s fresh water. Over 1,100 recorded plant species, 345 bird species and 85 known mammal species, including 13 of Africa’s primates – notably, chimpanzee, Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus and L’Hoest’s monkeys – are found in this exceptional landscape.
      <br/><br/>
      Historically, Nyungwe’s rich fauna and flora was exposed to rampant poaching, illegal mining, unsustainable harvesting and agricultural encroachment, endangering the survival of its rich biodiversity. Following a successful partnership with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) in Akagera National Park, in 2020 African Parks was invited by the Rwandan government to sign a 20-year agreement to manage Nyungwe. Together, we are working to restore and protect biodiversity, engage with the local communities, and develop a strong tourism offering to improve economic sustainability of the park. Today, the park is building a sense of ownership of conservation among the people who live around it, and developing an ecologically healthy and financially self-sufficient asset.`,

      <br/><br/>
      It is no surprise that tourists from the world over travel here to experience a Masai Mara Safari tour, more so as the reserve has been voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. Regarding the origin of the name, the word 'Masai' comes from the Maasai tribe, nomadic inhabitants of the area and the word 'Mara' is their word for 'spotted', referring to the ubiquitous flat topped acacia trees, shrubs and bushes that dot the landscape across most of the reserve.`,

    attractions: `The most thrilling of the activities has to be the Hot Air Balloon safari, taken at the break of dawn and ending with a leisurely 'Champagne Bush Breakfast'. This is a truly unique adventure activity and the Mara provides the perfect backdrop for the amazing balloon excursion. The flight lasts for about an hour as you glide gracefully over the African savannah watching the magnificent wildlife below. The pilots are highly experienced and the activity boasts of an exceptional safety record. Another popular experience is visiting a traditional tribal Maasai village which allows visitors a fascinating insight into the unique way of life of the famous Maasai, a nomadic warrior tribe found in Kenya and parts of East Africa.

    transport: `International air travel
    <br/>
    The recommended port of entry, when travelling to the Masai Mara, is Jomo Kenyatta International (NBO) in Nairobi. NBO Airport serves as East Africa's biggest hub and as a result many convenient flight options are available. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air France, British Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Kenya Airways, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and Swiss all operate flights from a multitude of major airports around the world. Also many regional flights options (including flights to neighbouring countries and Southern African destinations) are available.
    <br/><br/>
    Domestic air travel<br/>
    The favoured route for a Masai Mara fly-in safari is by flying from Nairobi Wilson Airport (WIL). From here it is a short (between 45 and 60 minutes) flight to the Mara. For this reason, flying into the Masai Mara is our recommended mode of travel. Although road conditions have improved in recent years, there are still considerable stretches of road that are in very poor condition. There are several airstrips in and around the Masai Mara for you to fly into. Which one you fly into will depend on where you decide to stay during your safari. Flights to the Mara are operated by airlines such as SafariLink and AirKenya. Upon your arrival at the airstrip closest to your accommodation, a safari vehicle will be waiting to take you to your Masai Mara safari lodge. The good news is... you are now in the Masai Mara – so you can start spotting wild animals by air during your flight and on the ground while in the safari vehicle taking you to your camp. Read all about flights to Masai Mara.
    <br/>
    It is also possible to fly from Kilimanjaro International Airport (JRO) in Tanzania. There are also direct flights (mostly in high season) from the Kenyan coast (Mombasa and Diani) and other national parks in Kenya such Amboseli National Park and Samburu National Reserve.

    overview: `Diani Beach Kenya is often referred to as a collective term for a group of interconnected beaches located south of Mombasa that make up Diani Beach. Two of the most popular beaches in Kenya are Diani Beach and Galu Beach, which each stretch for 15 kilometers over powdery white sand. Additionally, there are beaches such as Tiwi, Diani, Galu, Kikondo, and Chale that are also worth visiting on a Kenya Safari Tour to Diani Beach.
    <br/>
    The unique white sand that adorns our beautiful beach is blindingly white and ultra-fine, which in low tide can stretch as far as 150 meters. Diani Beach is protected by a shallow lagoon followed by a coral reef that is located about 1km from the low water mark. Aside from providing protection from the ocean, these islands also provide ideal conditions for swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving, kite surfing, and water sports like windsurfing and kiteboarding. The culture of the island not only revolves around beaches, but also active recreations. Across a wide range of ocean coasts, and just like on many other coastlines, stable winds provide good wave configurations. However, their height is significantly reduced by reefs, which are not very far from the shore.`,

The park features the Yatta Plateau, which is the longest lava flow in the world, stretching about 290 kilometers (180 miles) and formed from ancient volcanic activity. This plateau provides a unique geological backdrop but lacks the dramatic topography found in Tsavo West.

      The oasis banks of the Voi and Galana rivers and the enormous Aruba Dam, built across the Voi, attract game and birdlife galore that Kenya safari adventurers will revel. You’ll see herds of elephants and buffalo, waterbuck, and all kinds of animals coming to drink at the dam. The Lugard Falls, on the Galana River, is more a series of rapids than actual waterfalls; walk along the riverbank to catch a glimpse of the water-sculpted rocks.
      <br/><br/>
      Another fascinating feature in the park is the 180-mile-long Yatta Plateau, one of the world’s longest lava flows. It runs parallel to the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway and is 3 to 6 miles (5 to 10 km) wide and 1,000 feet (305 meters) high. Mudanda Rock, a 1.5-km (2-mile) outcropping, is a water catchment area. You’ll see plenty of wildlife coming to drink at the dam below.
      <br/><br/>
      The park became infamous in the late 1890s because of the “Man-Eaters of Tsavo,” a pride of lions that preyed on the Indian migrant laborers building the railway. More than 130 workers were killed; the incident was retold in the 1996 thriller The Ghost and the Darkness, starring Val Kilmer.`,

      The beautiful Aruba dam located to the north bank of the seasonal Voi River is visited by thousands of animals in the park and makes a great game viewing destination.
