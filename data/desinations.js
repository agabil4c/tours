    those spectacular destinations that most travellers have on their Africa 
    bucket list, and with good reason. There are a ton of magical places to visit in Kenya, 
    each offering their own unique charm and attractions. The Masai Mara is where to go in 
    Kenya for the famed and dramatic wildebeest migration, but there’s also a great deal 
    more to see in this East African country.<br/><br/>
    Kenya offers a holiday for every traveller. From unforgettable Kenya family safaris that offer 
    child-friendly activities and services, to exclusive hideaways for romantics, from adventurous 
    honeymoons to small groups of friends and family celebrating a milestone anniversary. Whatever 
    type of traveller you are, there’s not much that beats a Kenya holiday – the standards of service
     are high and Kenya’s top destinations offer luxury accommodation 
    ranging from lavish, colonial-style lodges to funky boutique hotels and amenity-packed resorts.<br/><br/>
    Kenya’s high population growth rate has produced a relatively young population. In the 1979 census 48.5% 
    of the population were less than 15 years old and this is estimated to have risen to 55% in 1988. The workforce is now smaller than its dependants. Most of Kenya’s 
    population live in the rural areas. In 1988 an estimated 18% of the population lived in urban areas. <br/><br/>
    Tourism is Kenya’s the second largest foreign exchange earner. The enduring appeal of the country’s 
    scenery, wildlife, climate and tropical coastline has allowed the establishment of a large hotel 
    industry and a sound tourism base. There is a fairly pronounced seasonal pattern with a majority 
    of tourists visiting during the northern hemisphere holiday period (July/August/September) and 
    during the northern winter months (December/January/February). 
    The rainy seasons in April/May and in November reduce the potential for visitors at these times.`,

          The nickname neatly sums up the East African country’s 
          rich beauty in three simple words, encapsulating everything from its vibrant colours and 
          lush vegetation to the magnificent wildlife that roams its plains. 
          Today, the moniker is as valid as ever, as Uganda has grown into one of Africa’s most 
          coveted travel sojourns.
          Uganda is home to the highest density of primates and gorillas in the world. 
          The expansive rainforest jungles of this landlocked country in East Africa are home
          to 20 species of primates, 
          including mountain gorillas, chimpanzees and golden monkeys.
          <br />
          <br />
          Visa and entry
          <br />
          A Single Entry Visa is $50 for most nationalities. 
          It is advised to get in advance from the Uganda eVisa website. 
          You can also get a Multi-Entry Visa and the East Africa 
          Tourist Visa (definitely apply in advance for these). 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          People & Culture
          <br/>
          Uganda’s 34 million people are concentrated in the country’s better watered south and west with the Kampala-based Baganda the largest of the country’s many ethnic groups. 
          Some 40 regional languages exist but Swahili and English are Uganda’s official languages. 
          Religious belief is overwhelmingly Christian-based though Islam is strong in Uganda’s Asian communities. 
          It should be noted that Ugandans hold their ancestry in high regard.
          Uganda is a conservative country and visitors would do well to adhere to local rules of behaviour. 
          That said, visitors often remark on the friendliness and politeness of the locals: greetings are an elaborate affair and may include inquiries as to the health of your family – perfunctory greetings and a demand for immediate action are somewhat frowned upon!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Languages
          <br/>
          Uganda is a multilingual nation with English as the official langauge and Swahili as the natural language. 
          However, thre are over 40 languages spoken across the country, reflecting its ethnic diversity. Luganda, spoken by the Baganda people, is widely spoken in the central region and is often used in business and daily transactions. 
          Other prominent languages include Runyankole in the west, Lusoga in the east, and Acholi in the north.
