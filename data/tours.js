The trip takes you to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to observe our closest cousins, the large mountain gorillas.

You can arrive in Kigali early in the morning, go to Bwindi, follow the gorillas the next day and return to Kigali. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park lies in the southwestern part of Uganda, on the edge of the exciting Albertine Rift. The park is bordered by the neighboring countries of Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Bwindi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with great biodiversity. There are more than 120 species of mammals, 350 species of birds, 310 species of magnificent butterflies and more than 200 species of trees. With all the remarkable attractions the park has to offer, the mountain gorillas seem to have stolen the show.",

Trekking to reach the gorillas is not a “walk in the park”. The terrain can be quite challenging due to the high altitude and the need to stray from visible trails. The gorillas themselves move freely in their habitat, so it can take anywhere from an hour to several hours to find them. The search for gorillas does not begin in Kinigi. You'll need to drive about 40 minutes to reach the trek's starting point, where you'll find porters for hire and free walking poles. Led by your guides, you will go in search of gorillas. After finding them, don't spend more than an hour following them, photographing them, and observing them as they feed and groom their young. Return to the starting point and get back on the road with your driver to return to the lodge. In the evening, after some rest, visit the Gorilla Keeper Village (formerly Iby'cwu Cultural Village) for an amazing cultural experience. Return to the lodge for dinner and overnight."

On this trip you will discover why Mount Mgahinga Park is called “the place where gold meets silver”. This small but very impressive park is the only place in Uganda where two endangered animal species (mountain gorillas and golden monkeys) coexist naturally. It's a place off the beaten track for most tourists and tour operators, but that's no longer the case since the only habituated gorilla family finally settled there. This family of gorillas previously crossed the border between Uganda and Rwanda. With such uncertainty, travelers did not want to take risks and therefore avoided the park when it came to gorilla trekking. This gorilla family is now a permanent resident of this park, which has made it a favorite gorilla trekking destination for many tourists. Our 3-day Silver and Gold tour is designed to take you to this place with magnificent views where you can track gorillas and golden monkeys, with pickup and drop-off from any part of Rwanda.",

On this trip you will discover why Mount Mgahinga Park is called “the place where gold meets silver”. This small but very impressive park is the only place in Uganda where two endangered animal species (mountain gorillas and golden monkeys) coexist naturally. It's a place off the beaten track for most tourists and tour operators, but that's no longer the case since the only habituated gorilla family finally settled there. This family of gorillas previously crossed the border between Uganda and Rwanda. With such uncertainty, travelers did not want to take risks and therefore avoided the park when it came to gorilla trekking. This gorilla family is now a permanent resident of this park, which has made it a favorite gorilla trekking destination for many tourists. Our 3-day Silver and Gold tour is designed to take you to this place with magnificent views where you can track gorillas and golden monkeys, with pickup and drop-off from any part of Rwanda.",

In anticipation of a shorter gorilla trek than the golden monkey trek, we planned for it to take place on the 3rd day (the same day we left for Kigali). This can still be changed. After the briefing, you will be taken into the forest by experienced rangers who will explain the natural history of these gorillas and give you more information about the park in general.
